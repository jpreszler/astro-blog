## Professional Experience
<p class="text-left">
I'm a data scientist who prefers neovim to jupyter notebooks. I like doing the engineering work as much as the model building. My main interests are:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><div class="text-left"> interaction of engineering and data science</div></li>
<li><div class="text-left"> time series modeling</div></li>
<li><div class="text-left"> clustering</div></li>
<li><div class="text-left"> probabilistic programming</div></li>
<li><div class="text-left"> RAG applications and knowledge graphs</div></li>
<li><div class="text-left"> testing, validating, and monitoring data science code</div></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text-left">
My recent experience is in start-ups, which fits my desire to work on a variety of projects and be able to do data science, analytics, engineering, and product management. I have experience as a sole data scientist inside an engineering org, growing and leading a small team (~5 reports), mentoring others, and going from 0 to 1 online ML models in an existing product.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
Currently, I'm at Mesmerise Solution Group doing consulting related to RAG applications and building protype RAG applications and knowledge graphs in several areas, such as healthcare, financial services, and aviation maintainence.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
Prior to Mesmerise, I was the Lead Data Scientist at Karat where I worked on supply and demand forecasting, pulling a rules based classifier out of a monolith into a microservice (and translating it from Ruby to Python, with LOTS of testing), candidate feedback insights, internal tooling for solutions engineers, and a Bayesian optimization system to tune client hiring bars among other things.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
Before Karat, I was briefly a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science where I did consulting with RealCrowd on a portfolio optimization tool. This helped me transition from academia into industry.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
For 10 years I was a professor, slowly moving from pure mathematics toward data science. I taught lots of statistics and calculus courses, but also several advanced undergraduate courses (real analysis, number theory, non-euclidean geometry) and a few computer science classes (intro programming, databases, computer architecture, and algorithms). My last academic position involved creating an undergraduate Data Science minor.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
My Ph.D. is in algebraic number theory and representation theory - basically finding patterns in integers (or algebraic extensions) and understanding large complicated objects by mapping them to well understood objects in structure-preserving ways (very similar to how vector embedding of text work).
</p>

## Computing Experience
<p class="text-left">
I grew up with computers before they were common place, and generally used a command line interface (my dad liked DR-DOS more than MS-DOS or windows). My first semester in college I took an intro programming course in C++ and was introduced to Linux. In late 1999 I installed Linux on my computer and never seriously used Windows again until late 2023, and then I basically just lived in WSL.
</p>

<p class="text-left">
After a lot of experimentation, I primarily used Slackware and then Arch with some Solaris during grad school (the University of Utah Math dept had lots of Sun systems then). I was essentially a double Math and CS major in college, but liked math a little more. I think that's only because data science wasn't as big a thing back then, so I didn't realize there was an applied middle ground. In grad school I was more computational than anyone in pure math, often writing code to look for examples or build datasets and doing a fair amount of computational number theory. 
</p>

<p class="text-left">
I continued doing lots of computational things after my Ph.D., and as I taught more statistics I became interested in statistical computing which lead into the world of data science.
